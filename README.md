# CAR SCANNERRS
My idea perhaps will be  to have AI to design car scan for check up and MOT of vehicles as this is still being done a lot by manual labour. This will reassure customers more and also cutting repeated visits to mechanics and garages for ongoing issues and cut cost for the longer term. This will make most cars safer and cleaner on the road which is important for our environment.
Background:
It happens that you take the car for a check up or MOT, they cannot be sure that certain things are in good order or not unless they have to use more labour hours to find  and diagnose the problem. This is very labour intensive and can take a long time to assess. Sometimes this create doubt in customer's mind too as you cannot be certain that the job needs to be done yet or not. It is not so obvious which job is of importance to be done.
How is it used:
Machine scan with inbuilt system consisted of different car models and sizes and also set up for different parts of the car
Once car has been scanned through and shows all the potential repairs and printed out, the owner can then see clearly all the issues (existing or coming up) - this will not only cut manual labour and working hours on specific cars a lot by also diagnose a lot of the problems in one go.
Data sources and AI methods:
It will be necessary to have an inbuilt AI system based on the logistics of how the cars are made up in the first place in factories to implement the figures on car performances and so on.
Challenges:
Perhaps sometimes the automated system might not be so accurate as when the job is performed by manual labour. An secondly, this will cut down on jobs. Some people might still prefer the old way of getting their car checked manually by their trustworthy mechanics
BIG PLUS:
This will mostly bring more revenue as a lot of customers will prefer an up to date machinery to fully scan their cars since this will be done to the highest standard possible. It will give customers peace of mind and also cutting costs for repeated smaller jobs. Everything will be on paper after scan so they can see for themselves what is wrong with the car and can decide which job they want done or of paramount.
What next: 
The scanner can be developed overtime to customise them more and more to specific diagnosis and also extending car models.
